## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ali, an enthusiast in networking and system administration who enjoys building, breaking, and learning how things work. My journey is focused on mastering networking concepts and hands-on simulation tools to bring theory to life.

My primary focus areas include Linux systems, scripting for automation, and exploring network architectures through platforms like EVE-NG and GNS3. Whether it's configuring routers in Packet Tracer, writing Bash scripts, or designing low-voltage electronic systems, I'm always driven by curiosity and precision.
